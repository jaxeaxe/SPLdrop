# SPLdrop

SPLdrop is a Batch Transaction DApp that can be used for airdrop campaigns or to transfer funds to thousands of addresses.

Visit https://spldrop.netlify.app/ to test the app
Refer to docs https://j-neeraja.gitbook.io/spldrop/ for instructions to use the app

NOTE: The app doesn't ask for Private Key as input. You can sign and send all the transactions at once using your Phantom Wallet. This is possible by using Phantom's signAllTransactions method. Further implementation details can be found in the docs.
